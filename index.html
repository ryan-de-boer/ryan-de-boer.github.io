2. Make sure MFC is installed you need to set your environment variables for PATH to add Generals\Code\Tools\NVASM<br>
3. Open the solution with vs22 and build it<br>
4. Copy the data and ini from above next to the built .exe<br>

The game can now load all loose files for modding(you will need to package your game to a .big file to ship your mod), download a big extractor extract all the .big files to the game folder(patch* ones last), then you 
can delete the big files.

For those who can't or don't want to compile it, here is a zip of the binaries. Combine it with your Generals installation (not zero hour). Only tested with the CD install (not steam but everyone says steam works too).<br>
